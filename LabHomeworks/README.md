### hw1_TheePotentiometersLED
A program that reads the value of three potentiometers (that represent Reed, Green and Blue) and sets the LED color intensity accordingly to their values.

### hw2_KnockToSing
A program that waits for a knock and then sings a song after a 5 seconds delay. The song can be stopped by pressing a button.

### hw3_JoystickControlled7Segment4Digit
A program that shows 4 digits on a 7 segment display. The digits can be changed individually with a joystick. The program can be in two states: in one you modify the currenrt digit and in the other one you change the digit you work with. The state is switched when you press the joystick.

### hw4_GameMenu
A game menu that lets you select between playing the game, editing the settings and viewing the highscore. The game section doesn't do much; it just shows you your lives, the current level and the score. The level increases by one after 5 seconds and the whole game has 10 seconds. In the settings section you can change the level (difficulty) and your name by entering it in the Arduino Serial Monitor. In the HighScore section you can see the best score ever achieved and also who had that score. The name and the score of the best player is saved, so Arduino will remember it even after it is shut down.
